## Before you begin

At first, is recommendable have installed the software EOSIO developed by Block.one to create actions with the EOS protocol following the command brew tap eosio/eosio y brew install eosio. This software it's made up of:

- **cleos**: is the command line tool that connects with the API exposed by nodeos and functions to manage the wallet, account, keys, transactions and Smart Contracts.
- **nodeos**: functions as the central daemon that manages EOSIO's net and could be configured as node to produce blocks.
- **eosd**: functions as wallet to manage the keys for EOSIO.

Additionally, we recommend install Contract Development Toolkit (CDT) beforehand, that can be installed using `brew tap eosio.cdt` command and followed by `brew install eosio.cdt` to access to the resources created by the contracts.
