  "description": "A contract is an agreement governing outcomes for actions, given a set of inputs. A contract can range from formal legal contracts (e.g., a financial transaction) to something as simple as the \"rules\" of a game. Typical actions can be things such as fund transfers (in the case of a financial contract) or game moves (in the case of a game contract).",
