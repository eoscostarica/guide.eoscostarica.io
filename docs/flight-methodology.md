## Edenia agile methodology!


We at Edenia are a company that uses agile methodologies that can be adapted to our flexible way of working.
Since we are not rigid when it comes to change and uncertainty, so we use a hybrid of different agile methodologies applied and tropicalized to our needs in processes.
we also like to be innovative not just with our software solutions but with our processes , constantly evolving and improving the way our team is organized to optimize how we deliver results.

## Ceremonies:

### Daily meeting 

The daily meeting is 30 min, and each pilot in charge of flights will give us their weather report and the progress obtained.
the pilot will indicate if they have any problems or need any help to land the flight on time.

### Grooming

This grooming ceremony takes place once a week for 30 minutes, where we develop the new flights in the different projects that are constantly being worked on.

## Flight handbook

Agile, light and unceremonious frame
to offer features in an efficient and continuous manner,
it is a way to align, plan and reflect on the work, it is something that must be carried out in the way that makes the most sense for the specific team; and does not conflict with the use practices of Flights.
For start-ups, and teams that typically work under conditions of extreme uncertainty, the ongoing approach will be far more beneficial.

## Flight definition 

You can see a flight as a fusion between a sprint and an epic.
It is a group of related tasks and has its own task board.
However, there are some key differences.
When you book a flight, you add tasks to it.
Tasks can be anything that needs to be done, but they are not restricted to the format of a "User Story" as we know it from Scrum.
As a general rule, it makes sense to book a flight with tasks that go together, depend on each other, or are expected to land at the same time.
However, nothing prevents you from adding unrelated tasks to a flight if there is "room for it".

### Flight Crew

- **Pilot:** It can be any person from the team, this person is in charge of delivering the flight with all the requirements and on time.

- **Co-Pilot:** As co-pilot, he must give support to the pilot, if necessary, and between the two of them, look for solutions if they encounter any turbulence.

- **Staff:** This member can be anyone on the team working on a task on the flight.

## Some recomendations about flights methodology are:

1. **Every flight must have a pilot**
2. **A developer can only be a pilot of one flight at a time (but can be a co-pilot or staff)**
3. **Developers can be staff on different flights at the same time**

## Flight status 

- **On Deck:** Flight is queued up for takeoff and staff can begin preparing.
- **At Gate:** Clear idea about the flight, what must be done to add value to the project.
- **Boarding:** Indicates that as soon as someone finishes a flight, it will be a high priority to make the new flight.
- **Flying:** When you are already working on the flight and you have a pilot, co-pilot and staff.
- **Delayed:** the flight has external or internal complications, it will not be able to land on time.
- **Landed:** this means the flight objetive was completed and flight has reached its destination

### Type of weather:

- **Clear:** the flight is without internal or external problems and is expected to be completed in the estimated time.
- **Cloudy:** It is when you have a small problem that you need help and it does not affect the landing time.
- **Turbulence:** Problems in the external or internal flight, and it is not possible to move forward, and this will affect the arrival time of the flight.
