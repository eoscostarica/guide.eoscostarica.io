APIs for integrating with EOSIO blockchains

## JavaScript

EOSJS is a JavaScript library for the integration with EOSIO based blockchains using EOSIO's RPC API. This library was created to provide a JavaScript interface for the interaction between web applications for the final user and EOSIO blockchains. As this develops a significant amount of applications in JavaScript, this library is designed to provide a higher support to the ecosystem in general and establishes the better practices in the industry for the interaction of the web applications with EOSIO blockchains.
