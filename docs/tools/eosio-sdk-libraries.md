## SDKs for EOSIO

APIs for integrating with EOSIO blockchains.

## JavaScript SDK

EOSJS is a JavaScript library for the integration with EOSIO based blockchains using EOSIO's RPC API. This library was created to provide a JavaScript interface for the interaction between web applications for the final user and EOSIO blockchains. As this develops a significant amount of applications in JavaScript, this library is designed to provide a higher support to the ecosystem in general and establishes the better practices in the industry for the interaction of the web applications with EOSIO blockchains.

### [eosjs](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosjs/latest/index)
A general purpose Javascript library which provides an API for integrating with EOSIO-based blockchains using the EOSIO Nodeos RPC API.

### [eosjs-keygen](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs-keygen)
A Javascript library for managing keys in local storage.
