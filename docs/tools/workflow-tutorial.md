## Git workflow Tutorial


In this tutorial, we explain step by step how to program an open source project using the **GitHub** platform. This is a repository with access to various functions and tools for project development and administration.

**GitHub** contains a function called `forking`, which allows you to copy a repository from another account and request access to modify it in the user's account. In case the user decides to make sharing changes, he can send a notification to the original owner of the repository called `pull request`. In this way, you can unify the changes with the original repository, this is called `merge`.
