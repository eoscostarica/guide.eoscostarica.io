### Squash merge

Squash merging is a `merge` option that allows you to condense the Git history of topic branches when you complete a `pull request`. Instead of each `commit` on the topic `branch` being added to the history of the default `branch`, a squash merge takes all the file changes and adds them to a single new `commit` on the default `branch`.

* * *

### Stablecoin

A token whose value is intended to remain stable.  This can be done by pegging to another currency or token, or algorithmically. Many stablecoins peg to the US dollar, meaning that one token should always be redeemable for one US dollar.

* * *

### Stake 

Staking is the act of locking tokens for resources on an EOSIO network. This includes but is not limited to, CPU time, RAM, and on-chain governance.

* * *

### Standby BP

A set of about 100 full nodes that have expressed the desire to be selected as block producers, and are capable of doing so on demand. Whenever the chain needs to replace an existing BP with a new one, the new one is drawn from the standby pool.

* * *

### StoryBook

[StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular. 

* * *

### System Account

These are accounts that begin with the prefix eosio.* and hold either the code or the funds for native blockchain actions (such as voting, multisig, account creation, and so on).

* * *

## **T**

### TaPoS - Transaction as Proof of Stake

` TaPoS`  is used to ensure that a user fetches the recent state of the top of the blockchain to prove that they are aware of the state of the chain when signing a transaction. This helps to prevent certain forms of attacks, such as a replay attack where a malicious user tries to replay a transaction, despite the state of the associated accounts having already been changed.

* * *

### Telos

[Telos](https://www.telos.net/) is a blockchain platform without high-performance permissions for decentralized applications with advanced data storage and governance functions.

* * *

### Terraform 

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) it is a tool to build, change and version infrastructure in a safe and efficient way. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom internal solutions.

* * *

### TestNet 

A test network or testnet is an instantiation of the EOSIO platform that is intended for testing purposes. Generally, the native token has no value and is given away to developers so they can test.

* * *

### Tokens

The unit of measurement of a cryptocurrency.

* * *

### TPS

A metric by which the performance of a blockchain is measured.

* * *

### Transactions

It is a combination of one or more actions. Usually the result of executing a smart contract.

* * *

## **U**

### UAL (Universal Authenticator Library)

Developed by EOSIO Labs, the [Universal Authenticator Library (UAL)](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library) allows app developers to integrate with a variety of authenticators (wallets, app explorers, key managers, etc.) by coding to a single, universal API.

* * *

### UX Design

It is the design process that development teams use to create products that provide enjoyable experiences for users.

* * *

## **V**

### Vote

Voting is a fundamental part of the system. The most widely used application of voting is to elect which Block Producers will actually produce blocks for the network. Voting will also be used to help collect the communal decisions through which we will change the course of the network.

* * *

### Vote Decay

To discourage users from casting a vote for Block Producers and then not updating their vote periodically, a decay in the relative vote strength of old votes was introduced. To maintain maximum vote strength, a user should vote at least once per week.

* * *

## **W**

### Wallet

`Wallets` are clients that store keys that may or may not be associated with the permissions of one or more accounts. Ideally a wallet has a locked (encrypted) and unlocked (decrypted) state that is protected by a high entropy password.

* * *

### Wasm

The EOSIO based blockchains execute user-generated applications and code using WebAssembly. 

WASM is an emerging web standard with widespread support of Google, Microsoft, Apple, and others. At the moment the most mature toolchain for building applications that compile to WASM is clang/llvm with their C/C++ compiler. 

* * *

### Whale

Makes references to a chip holder who has a very big bet.

* * *

### Whitelist

A whitelist is a subjective measure that a blockchain node can implement to allow transactions to be placed in a block only if they are listed in your account or contract whitelist. Each node can specify its own whitelist, which cannot be seen publicly.

* * *

### WPS (Worker Proposal System)

It is a system through which community funds would be used to support blockchain improvements, community projects, and anything the community deemed worthy of public funds. It is configured to be financed through part of inflation.

* * *

## **X**


* * *

## **Y**

### Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager for web projects that supports the npm package manager structure (package.json y node_modules)

* * *

## **Z**

### Zeplin

[Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) is a collaborative tool for designers and Front-End developers that allows a workflow in which they can create designs, facilitating communication, and better organization of time.
