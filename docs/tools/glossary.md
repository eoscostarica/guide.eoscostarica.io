### Proof of Work

`Proof of Work` is a consensus mechanism used by many blockchains, most notably by Bitcoin. The miner of the next block is the first to solve a hashing problem. The difficulty of this problem increases as more hashing power attempts to solve this problem at the same time. The ever-increasing amount of work that has gone into a blockchain over time is what protects the chain's history.

* * *

### Ricardian Contract

In the EOSIO based blockchain context `Ricardian Contract` is a digital document that accompanies a smart contract and defines the terms and conditions of an interaction between the `smart contract` and its users, written in human readable text, which is then cryptographically signed and verified. It is easily readable for both humans and programs, and aids in providing clarity to any situations that may arise in the interactions between `smart contract` and its users.

### Smart Contract

A `smart contract` is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

* * *

### SPOF

Part of a system that if it fails to detect the operation of the entire system. These are not desirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability.

* * *

### Squash Merge

Squash merging is a `merge` option that allows you to condense the Git history of topic branches when you complete a `pull request`. Instead of each `commit` on the topic `branch` being added to the history of the default `branch`, a squash merge takes all the file changes and adds them to a single new `commit` on the default `branch`.

* * *

### Stablecoin

A `token`whose value is intended to remain stable.  This can be done by pegging to another currency or token, or algorithmically. Many stablecoins peg to the US dollar, meaning that one token should always be redeemable for one US dollar.

* * *

### Stake 

Your total `EOS token` holding is referred to as your stake.

* * *

### Standby BP

A set of about 100 full nodes that have expressed the desire to be selected as block producers, and are capable of doing so on demand. Whenever the chain needs to replace an existing BP with a new one, the new one is drawn from the standby pool.

* * *

These are accounts that begin with the prefix eosio.* and hold either the code or the funds for native blockchain actions (such as voting, multisig, account creation, and so on).

* * *

## **T**

### TaPoS - Transaction as Proof of Stake

` TaPoS` is used to ensure that a user fetches the recent state of the top of the blockchain to prove that they are aware of the state of the chain when signing a transaction. This helps to prevent certain forms of attacks, such as a replay attack where a malicious user tries to replay a transaction, despite the state of the associated accounts having already been changed.

* * *

### Telos

* * *

### Tokens

The unit of measurement of a cryptocurrency.

* * *

### TPS

* * *

### UX Design

It is the design process that development teams use to create products that provide enjoyable experiences for users.

* * *

## **V**

### Vote

Voting is a fundamental part of the system. The most widely used application of voting is to elect which Block Producers will actually produce blocks for the network. Voting will also be used to help collect the communal decisions through which we will change the course of the network.

* * *

### Vote Decay

To discourage users from casting a vote for Block Producers and then not updating their `vote` periodically, a decay in the relative vote strength of old votes was introduced. To maintain maximum vote strength, a user should vote at least once per week.

* * *

## **W**
