### SPOF

Part of a system that if it fails to detect the operation of the entire system. These are not desirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability.

* * *

### Squash Merge

Squash merging is a `merge` option that allows you to condense the Git history of topic branches when you complete a `pull request`. Instead of each `commit` on the topic `branch` being added to the history of the default `branch`, a squash merge takes all the file changes and adds them to a single new `commit` on the default `branch`.

* * *

### Stablecoin

A `token`whose value is intended to remain stable.  This can be done by pegging to another currency or token, or algorithmically. Many stablecoins peg to the US dollar, meaning that one token should always be redeemable for one US dollar.

* * *

### Stake 

Your total `EOS token` holding is referred to as your stake.

* * *

### Standby BP

* * *

## **T**

### TaPoS - Transaction as Proof of Stake

` TaPoS` is used to ensure that a user fetches the recent state of the top of the blockchain to prove that they are aware of the state of the chain when signing a transaction. This helps to prevent certain forms of attacks, such as a replay attack where a malicious user tries to replay a transaction, despite the state of the associated accounts having already been changed.

* * *
