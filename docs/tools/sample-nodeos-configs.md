For example configurations for different EOSIO node types, you can visit the [Sample Nodeos Configurations](https://github.com/eoscostarica/sample-nodeos-configs) repository, which contains a collection of nodeos configuration files and other helpful resources meant to assist students of the [EOSIO Node Operator](https://training.eos.io/courses/eosio-node-operator) and [EOSIO Blockchain Administrator](https://training.eos.io/courses/eosio-blockchain-adminstrator) courses learn from first-hand experience.

There are also four student lab assignments included in this repository that must be completed by students to obtain the course certification.
