  --trace-minimum-irreversible-history-blocks arg (=-1)
                                        Number of blocks to ensure are kept 
                                        past LIB for retrieval before "slice"

                                        A value of -1 indicates that automatic 
                                        removal of "slice" files will be turned

                                        retrieval
                                        A value of -1 indicates that automatic

                                        in the form <account-name>=<abi-def>
                                        Where <abi-def> can be:
                                           an absolute path to a file 
                                        containing a valid JSON-encoded ABI
                                           a relative path from `data-dir` to a
                                        file containing a valid JSON-encoded 
                                        ABI
                                        
  --trace-no-abis                       Use to indicate that the RPC responses 
                                        will not use ABIs.
                                        Failure to specify this option when 
                                        there are no trace-rpc-abi 
                                        configuations will result in an Error.
                                        This option is mutually exclusive with 
                                        trace-rpc-api
