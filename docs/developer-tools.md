## EOSIO

### What is EOSIO?

EOSIO is open-source software that enables launching highly configurable blockchain networks on which developers and entrepreneurs can run highly performant blockchain applications. For more depth information about EOSIO visit [Learn EOS](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/eos-learn/eosio-protocol).

### Why we use EOSIO?

Here are some reasons why we use EOSIO:

1. **It's scalable**. For businesses that need to transact with thousands of customers simultaneously, for example, this transaction speed is insufficient. EOSIO, on the other hand, has been benchmarked to process over 4,000 transactions per second on its public blockchain, which means that it is 200 times faster than its closest competitor and that’s just the public network.  

2. **It’s fast**.  By using EOSIO apps, consumers and enterprises do not even need to know that they’re using a ‘blockchain app’; all they know is that whatever data they have inputted for any transaction is more secure but no slower than your normal, non-blockchain app.  

3. **It’s virtually free**. Unlike other blockchain protocols, EOSIO offers a more favorable cost model for consumers and developers, as it eliminates the need for transaction fees.  

4. **It’s green**. One of the most common complaints you hear about blockchain technology is just how expensive and environmentally-unfriendly it is. Indeed, a lot of blockchain platforms require a substantial amount of electricity to run the computers needed to manage the distributed database.

## jq

### What is jq?

A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. jq is like [sed](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/) for JSON data you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.

## React JS

### What is React JS?

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

### Why we use React JS?

1. **Fast Learning Curve**. React is very a simple and lightweight library that only deals with the view layer.
2. **Reusable Components**. React provides a component based structure. Components are your lego pieces. You start with tiny components like button, checkbox, dropdown etc. and the you create wrapper components composed of those smaller components.
3. **Fast render with Virtual DOM**. Updating DOM is usually the bottleneck when it comes to the web performance. React is trying to solve this problem by using something called virtual DOM; a DOM kept in memory.
4. **Great Developer Tools**. Developer toolset is another important factor when you are choosing a development platform. There are two great tools you should be aware of: React Developer Tools and Redux Developer Tools. Both can be installed as Chrome extensions.

## HAPI

### What is HAPI?

Hapi is a rich and open source Node.js framework. Hapi is a rich framework for creating applications and services. It allows developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of wasting time creating infrastructure.

### Why we use HAPI?

1. **Backed by major corps**. This means the community support will be strong, and there for you throughout future releases. It's easy to find passionate Hapi people, and there are good tutorials out there. As of this post date npm and Walmart use Hapi.
2. **Facilitate work**. It can facilitate the work of distributed teams working on various parts of the backend services without having to have comprehensive knowledge of the rest of the API surface (Hapi's plugins architecture is the epitome of this quality).
3. **Let the framework do what a framework is supposed to: configure things**. After that the framework should be invisible and allow devs to focus their real creative energy on building out business logic.
