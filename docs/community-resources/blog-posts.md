## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain technology offers improved security, transparency, privacy, traceability and efficiency for companies and organizations.

A blockchain acts as a distributed ledger of information shared by a network of trusted computers that validate each new evolution before adding it to the registry. This **chain** of data can only grow in size, which means that to modify a record, a user must request a new modification. This makes the data on a blockchain unalterable and avoids human error when recording transactions.
