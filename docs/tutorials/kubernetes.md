Kubernetes is an open source platform, which was created by Google, used for the management, deployment, scalability and monitoring of Docker containers. 

### Kubernetes Features

- Intelligent container deployment.
- Management of workloads (provides load balancing).
- Easy management of services and applications.
- High availability.
- Great flexibility and allows modular work.
- Container monitoring.

### Kubernetes Architecture

There are two main roles, "master" and "node". The master is in charge of managing and orchestrating the different microservices between the 4 available nodes in the cluster.

### Key Concepts in k8s

**Cluster:** It is a group of devices that can be physical or virtual, are united many times by a network and, therefore, they behave as one.

**Kubernetes node:** A machine that is running Kubernetes, on which pods can be programmed.

**Pod:** A group of one or more containers that share the storage and configurations needed to run.

**Replication Controller:** It is the one who handles the above mentioned failures and recreates, if necessary, the pods. In addition, it also ensures that the number of replicas of the pod is running.

**Service:** It is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods, as well as the rules and logic to access them.

**Infrastructure as IaC Code**  
A repository will be created with code for the design and deployment of the project's infrastructure. This will represent the desired state on the servers, as well as pre-compiled images of each service to be deployed.
