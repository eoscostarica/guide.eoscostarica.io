# Why we like to use a Boilerplate

The main advantages of having a  boilerplate is that it may use be used in every release . There’s no need to come up with something new every time if you’ve already produced a strong boilerplate.

Every day, the persons who decide whether or not to publish a press release receive a flood of questions. However, a well-written boilerplate will distinguish your business as professional and media-savvy. And they will have a clearer idea of who is contacting them.

Some benefits of using a Boilerplate consists of:

- Documentation that is easy to read and understand
- Coding standards and rules are followed
- Easy testing tools and mandatory API modules are included
- The tool’s CLI (command-line interface) allows for immediate setup and rapid prototyping
