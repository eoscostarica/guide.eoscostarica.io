## Development Process

We use a Kanban-style board to prioritize the work. For example the [EOS rate project board](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eos-rate/projects/1).

We have added a additional column to the default automated board in order to maintain a prioritized `To Do` column.

When a new issues is create you need to explicitly use the project option on the GitHub issue to include it in the board; Once you do that it gets automatically added to the New Issues column.

Periodically we move the new Issues to the `To Do` column and manually and give it the appropriate priority.

When you start working on a task you must manually move it to `In Progress` column.

We use GitHub flow https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/ to request code changes.
We develop on `master` and `release` using tags with semver versioning.

New and reopened `pull request` are automatically added to the board in the `In Progress` column.

When the pull request is closed is moved to the `Done` column automatically. If the pull request closes and issues it is properly stated with the GitHub keywords closes in the pull request it gets automatically moved to the `Done` column too.

## Branch Naming Convention

Name every branch for your pull requests using the following simple convention:

```
<type>/<task-description>-<issue-number>
```

* Always use lowercase.
* Choose the [type](#type).
* Meaningful and short descriptions.
* Use hyphens as separators.
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
* Use the ``issue`` number to reference it in the branch.

-**Example**:

```
feat/new-feature-123
^--^ ^---------^ ^-^
  |       |       |
  |       |       +-> Issue number
  |       |
  |       +-> Short description of the task
  |
  +-> Type: build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test, content, or devtools
```

## Pull Request General Guidelines

* Please check to make sure that there aren't existing `pull request` attempting to address the `issue` mentioned.
* Check for related `issues` on the `issue tracker`.
* Non-trivial changes should be discussed on an issue first.
* Develop in a topic branch, never on master: `git checkout -b type/task-issue`.
* Provide useful `pull request` description.
* Make well scoped `atomic` pull requests. 1 PR per feature of bug fix.
* Link the `issue` on the `pull request` description for cross references between code and issues.

We only support support **squash merge** of the `pull requests` as a best practice for ensure the `master` log is maintained clean and relevant, without requiring the pull request to be rebased. This strategy requires that all pull request made are `atomic`, in other words they solve one thing only.  One pull request per feature, bug fix or documentation update.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our `git` commit messages can be formatted, following GitHub conventions and standards.  This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also, we use the `git` commit messages to **generate the project change log**.

We follow the commit message conventions as shown below:

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The ```header``` is mandatory and the ```scope``` of the header is optional.

** Example:**

```
feat: add a new method
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> abstract in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: build, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, style, test, content, or devtools.

```

The commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters. This allows the message to be easy to read on GitHub as well as various `git tools`.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

** The commit message must be like the following samples: **
```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
```

```
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
```

Even more [samples](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
* **chore**: What a user would not see (changes to the build process, configuration, etc).
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
* **docs**: Documentation only changes.
* **feat**: A new feature for the user.
* **fix**: A bug fix for the user.
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (renaming a variable).
* **revert**: Reverts a previous commit.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
* **content**: Adding or removing content.
* **devtools**: Developer tooling related.

### Scope

The scope is the name of the component or service that it affects. Eg:

* **common**
* **smart-contracts**
* **webapp**
* **storage**
* **graphql**
* **frontend**
* **demux**
* **docker**

### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub `issues` that this commit closes.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting your `issue` please check that you've completed the following steps:

* Made sure you're on the latest version.
* Used the search feature to ensure that the bug hasn't been reported before.

Bug reports should contain the following information:

* Summary: A brief description.
* Steps to reproduce: How did you encounter the bug? Instructions to reproduce it.
* Expected behavior: How did you expect it to behave?
* Actual behavior: How did it actually behave?
* References: Links to any related tickets or information sources.
* If possible, attach visual documentation of the bug. Screenshot or animated gif.

## Releases

We release the production software version using github tags following [Semver](http://semver.org), except the version roles have the semantic names, "Breaking.Feature.Fix" instead of "Major.Minor.Patch".

#### Breaking.Feature.Fix

We don't decide what the version will be. The API changes decide. Version numbers are for computers, not people. Release names are for people.

##### Breaking

Any breaking change, no matter how small increments the Breaking version number. Incrementing the Breaking version number has absolutely no relationship with issuing a release.

##### Feature

When any new feature is added. This could be as small as a new public property, or as large as a new module contract being exposed.

##### Fix

When a documented feature does not behave as documented, or when a security issue is discovered and fixed without altering documented behavior.

### Changelog Generation

On each release we generate a changelog file to document changes using the standard [git-changelog](https://github.com/rafinskipg/git-changelog) package. There's an npm task for it.

## Advanced Git Tools

There are also tools like [Hub](https://hub.github.com/) and [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras) that facilitate interacting with Github. You can leverage these tools to contribute to this repository.

## Code Standards

We use the [standardjs code style](https://standardjs.com).

## Continuous Integration and Delivery

This is a work in progress, we are going to probably want to use Netifly and TravisCI.

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure that both the code standards and commit message conventions are met.
